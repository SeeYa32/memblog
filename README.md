A story of my memblog.

.02 September 5th, 2012
Fixed a few things on the blog, and by few, I mean many. Well, here it goes.

	1. Added the Page template, so now pages can be created
	2. One can now search using the search template, though no searchbar is on the website yet
	3. Archiving service should be working now
	4. Author and Category templates created
	5. Footer theme copyright information added
	6. Widgets should be updating properly now
	7. Single posts should be able to be viewed properly now
	8. Centered everything to make it a little more pleasing
	
Future Possibilities:

	1. Logging of devices and IP Addresses
